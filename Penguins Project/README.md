The data set used in this project is the Palmer Penguins data set. 

The goal of this project is to determine a small set of measurements that are highly preditive of a penguins species. 

1. Imported and cleaned the data.
2. Did an exploratory analysis by computing summary statistics and constructing visualizations about
the relationships between variables.
3. Performed a formal feature selection using exhaustive search.
4. Deployed three machine learning models including the Logistic Regression model, the Support Vector Machine model, 
and the Random Forest model. 
5. The accuracy scores are 97.01%, 91.04%, and 92.54% respectively. 
6. Created decision region plots to highlight model prediction errors and discuss what we can do to improve.
